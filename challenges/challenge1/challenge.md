# Writing Challenge #1:
Hello Writers! We're excited to announce the first Writing Challenge! These challenges serve the purpose of getting more experienced while we wait to finish pre-production on Book 4 and 5, as well as seeing which writers would be the more adept at leading others once we'll start forming teams.

### Prompt
*Write the first chapter of Magium either from Daren's perspective, or in third person limited following Daren. Have the chapter begin before Daren encounters Cutthroat Dave. For those who don't remember, Chapter 1 ends right before Kate is introduced.*

Format: Short Story 
Minimum word requirement: 4000 
Deadline:  September 14, 2024 2:00 PM

Entries will need to be submitted [here.](https://forms.gle/jRqBBtox4GcWShuH7)

Each entry will then be shown anonymously and people will give each work a rating between 1 and 5. After this, the 3 winners will be announced.
