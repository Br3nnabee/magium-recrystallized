How far would you go to save the world? To make sure that there will never again be a single criminal or a crying child on the street. For me, I would do whatever it takes, especially if I have the power to do so. People might call me crazy or even stupid, but I have found a way.

During one of my various travels throughout the world, I heard about a competition of the century, the Magium tournament. A tournament between only the strongest of mages for the ultimate prize, the Magium. Nobody has exactly seen it, but it is widely known as the source of all magic. I finally found a way to achieve my dreams.

However, it seems that the gods do not care for my great ambition as the beginning of this tournament had everything going against me.

I was lucky enough to be among the first group to be teleported to the continent. I suddenly found myself in a forest. For some reason, I feel underwhelmed. For a continent that houses the most powerful artifact in the world, I thought it would be more impressive.

The first thing I tried to do is contact my wife using a transceiver which I enchanted specifically to carry a signal across multiple continents, but it seems to be blocked. Is it intentional? Why didn’t they inform us about this? Does it have something to do with the fact that Verathia is a continent nobody knows how to get to? I can only hope that Sophie came to the same conclusion that I did.

With each sound of the teleporter bringing people to the continent, the sounds of magic battles get louder and louder.

Why are people already fighting? I know that this is a tournament, but the way to progress is to do objectives!

Speaking of, why aren’t we being given any? Didn’t the tournament organizers tell us that we will be given them telepathically once we get teleported!?

Wait, relax, I’m being too impatient. First, they’ll finish teleporting everybody, then they’ll give us our objectives, then people will stop the pointless fighting.

After calming down, I used the time before everyone got here to stop the fights nearby and heal anybody who suffered because of them.

Since the scar in the shape of an x on my forehead is enough for people to know who I am, people listen and go off on their way pretty easily. Even if they don’t know, I believe that the appearance of a tall experienced adventurer from the southern continent wearing enchanted armor will be enough to scare any idiot who came here with a stick up their ass.

Right after I stopped another fight, a participant tried to sneak up on me.

“I know you’re there, get out of the bush” I said, “Or better yet, go away. I’m not trying to cause unnecessary bloodshed”.

Upon seeing that his attempt at stealth was unsuccessful, he made a “tsk” sound with his mouth and walked out with confidence. He wore a white shirt with a stain on it and leather pants with a belt full of knives. He also had a black unkept beard and a smell that didn’t help his assassination attempt.

He spits on the ground and says “You arrogant mages really don’t know what’s good for you, aye. I was trying to let you off easy by hitting you in the head with one clean blow, but hey, who am I for trying to be charitable?”

Somehow, I didn’t assume that the ‘idiot with a stick up their ass’ would approach danger regardless of their enemy’s appearance.

At this point, I should have been more careful.

I smiled and said, “Look man, I admire your composure, but if you’re trying to win fights with threats, at least measure your opponents’ strength first”

The unkept gentleman put on a cocky smile behind his beard and said “Hah! Say’s you! You can’t trick me, I know your kinds’ tricks! Just look scary and have an enchantment that makes your aura look scary! Just prepare to fight you coward!”

This guy needs to learn some synonyms. I’m surprised he actually knows a tactic that some enchanters use. However, the problem with that is because it is very easy to check if it is false or not. Ah, who cares if he knows. I know your kind’s tricks too. This guy’s definitely the type to use one type of attack to distract his opponent and then try to surprise them with a spell they can only cast once. Fortunately, he doesn’t know that doing the opposite would be the thing that could beat me.

I mean, who would be stupid enough to enter this tournament without precautions, right?

“Alright, you asked for this!” I say as I run towards him with my shield in front of me. As the fight starts, he takes his knives and throws them at me and starts running – surprisingly enough, away from me. The knives bounce off the shield in different directions, but stop in midair as they go back towards me, but this time aiming directly at my joints, where the gaps in my armor are, but I also block those easily. As we’re both running, he throws more homing knives, but I’m unable to catch up to him because of the difference in weight of our equipment. It gets harder to block all the knives, as some of them inevitably start to hit their targets.

Alright, this isn’t a good situation to be in, but he is probably aware that almost every mage has a magic shield spell that protects them from most physical damage. Well… except for me, but he doesn’t know that, so he has to use his trump card soon. This will give me a chance to win because I have a sword that can absorb any magic projectile that’s thrown towards it.

The fight continues for a few minutes, but the situation isn’t changing since the tactic is the same.

Wait… don’t tell me… IS THIS ACTUALLY THIS GUY’S WHOLE PLAN?! He doesn’t have a single spell and is only using some homing knives?? They’re not even that sharp! Yet I’m losing! This is bad, very bad. Since I don’t have a single ranged attack, the only thing he needs to do is keep doing the same thing over and over until I fall due to the injuries!

The fight continues until I fall on my knees.

How is this possible? To face my worst weakness as my first opponent, the gods must really want me dead. I can’t make a barrier because it has the same weakness as me, even if I had the strength to lift it. My white magic is just as useless since it takes time and makes a light shine on me, thus robbing me of any chance of a surprise attack I could have thrown at him.

If only I was more careful, or looked for shelter instead of trying to stop fights. No, I don’t regret those. I saved those I could and I’m happy I stopped some death occurring before the tournament even started.

My opponent stopped running since I fell and has been looking at me with an arrogant grin on his face while playing with one of his knives.

“The legendary mage Daren! The savior of the Eastern Continent. The healer in armor. They say you’ve travelled the world, saving countless villages from destruction. That you’ve once fought ten rock golems by yourself, only to defend a small child. I guess this goes to show, you should never really trust legends, aye? I always knew all of those tales about mages as strong as giants were just codswallop. Hell, if all those ‘legendary’ mages are as weak as you, I’m going to win this by sundown!” and starts laughing.

This couldn’t get any worse. Hold on…

My opponent stops laughing at the same time and seemingly for the same reason.

“Wait, who’s there?” he says and turns to his left.

Something seemingly moved in that direction, but I’m too injured to look closely. I can’t sense anything either. It can’t be… a stillwater

Stillwaters are a very rare breed of mages, that are known to be incredibly powerful. One of them is said to have destroyed an entire city in an instant some twenty years ago, with only a flick of his fingers. The city of Olmnar was said to have been one of the greatest cities on this continent, but it was wiped off the map just like that, in a single second. Such is the power of these stillwaters.

But what is even more interesting about these stillwaters is that you can’t differentiate them from normal humans. Normally, you can sense the magic flowing from every being. You don’t even need to be a mage to do it. By sensing their magical aura, you can tell how strong mages are before engaging them in a fight. But as my opponent pointed out, there are also other ways that can change them.

The question is, why is he here? Does he want to torment some thug for the fun of it? Or does he want something else? Hmm…

“I know you’re there, coward. Show yourself, or I’ll have one of my knives find you!”

Completely opposite of my reaction, as expected.

“I see no reason to show myself to you” the stillwater says.

As we hear the stillwater’s voice, we pinpoint the exact tree he is standing behind.

After a long pause, he says in a shaky voice “A stillwater, eh” he tried to keep his composure, but he isn’t kidding anybody. He’s afraid.

Wow, so he’s not completely insane.

After some silence, he says “You don’t scare me stillwater! I’m going to fill you with holes and you’ll end up begging me for mercy! I bet your legends are no more true than they were for this sad excuse for a mage standing next to me”.

… damn it all!

“That’s funny,” the stillwater tells him. ”That’s almost the same thing the people of Olmnar told me. Before I burned their city to the ground”.

After he says that, there’s another long pause in which none of us says anything.

“You’re bluffing” my opponent says.

The stillwater says “I guess there’s only one way to find out then,” and starts another silence where I’m almost certain that my opponent will start throwing knives just for his pride.

Finally, my opponent responds with “You’re in luck, stillwater. I’m feeling merciful today. I’m going to be out of your hair just as soon as I finish this guy here”.

Actually, I’m not sure you will.

“You do that and you’ll regret it,” the stillwater says quickly.

That sentence surprised my opponent greatly.

“What, are you kidding me? You’re going to defend this lowlife?”.

“If I have to. Do I have to?”.

My opponent falls silent for the last time and says “I’ll remember this, stillwater. Don’t think I won’t. You’ll rue the day you messed with Cutthroat Dave. And the same goes for you, healer in armor. I’ll be seeing the both of you again soon.” After which he turns around in disgust and heads into the woods on the opposite side of the clearing.

Alright, I’ve decided. For the remainder of this tournament, I’m going to be putting my goal of winning the tournament aside, as helping this stillwater with what he needs takes priority.

The stillwater finally shows himself from behind a tree and sighs.

He looks rather ordinary. He is light-skinned and looks to be in his twenties. He has short brown hair, brown eyes and a short beard. He is wearing a white buttoned-up shirt, brown pants and boots.

I sheathe sword, pick up my shield and walk towards him. I am deciding to be as nice as possible, not because he is a stillwater, but because he saved my life.

“You had no obligation to save me,” I say. “But you did so anyway, at the risk of your own life. I cannot let such selflessness go unrewarded. I, Daren, vow this day that I will offer you my protection from this moment, and until the end of this tournament. Tell me, brave soul, what is your name?”

“It’s, uhh… It’s Barry. My name is Barry.”

HA HA, HAHAHAHA, NO, no way the all powerful stillwater who eclipses the power of most people in the tournament, is named Barry!

At this moment I try to contain my laughter but I fail miserably. I mean, how can someone so powerful have such a name. Just imagining a title like ‘The skull crusher’ or ‘The all knowing’ being followed by Barry is so unbelievable, I couldn’t help but laugh.

“Now that’s the weirdest name for a mage I’ve heard of in my life. Especially for a stillwater. Do you have something you want to tell me, Barry?”

“I’m not a stillwater, Daren.” Barry replied ”That thug just assumed I was and I took advantage of the situation.”

“But you’re not one of the locals either. Otherwise that spell of theirs would have alerted us the moment we sensed your presence.”

I am talking about the spell the organizers of the tournament cast on each of the participants before teleporting us here. We aren’t allowed to hurt the humans that live on this continent, so their spell warns us when one of them is near. If what they said can be believed, their spell is supposed to stop us even before we try hurting any of the locals. If it’s accidental then it simply stops us before doing it. If it’s intentional, it eliminates us from the tournament and sends us back. Their spell is also supposed to act as a means of communication with the organizers. They said they’ll transmit the objectives to each of us individually. It’s weird they even let people without magic, like Barry, participate.

“So you must be a participant then,” I continue. ”What reason would you have to participate in a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world?”

To me, there only seems to be two, either this man is unlucky and was forced into it. Or, gods forbid, he had to do it for somebody else’s sake like fulfilling their wish or finding a cure for an illness.

“Why did you join this tournament, Barry”

Now of course, there is an obvious answer that I am avoiding, but surely he isn’t foolish enough to-

“I’m after the same thing as you, Daren,” he says ”I’m after the Magium. It’s been my dream ever since I was little to become a mage, and the Magium can grant me that wish.”

“Come on, Barry. You’re going to have to make up a better lie than that if you want me to believe you!”

I look him straight in the eye and I see that look. I recognize that look.

No… It resembles the one I had when I came up to my master for the first time and asked him to be his student. I can’t believe this! A second person who entered the most dangerous tournament in the world with no precautions! It’s like he has no regards for his own life!

“By the gods… You are being serious! Barry, I commend your bravery and determination but… You do realize you can’t win this entire tournament just by bluffing, don’t you?”

“Of course I know that! That’s not the only ace I have up my sleeve. But what about you? They say you are one of the strongest mages in the world. So how does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave?”

“Oh, that…”

“You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly…”

“The shield spell? The one that casts an invisible protective layer arount yourself? But isn’t that one of the first spells any mage learns?”

Don’t remind me…

“It is… But it’s not like I can’t cast it at all… I can defend from magic just fine. It’s normal weapons that I have a problem with. This is why I wear armor. This is why I use a sword and a shield. I first started using them because I couldn’t use the shield spell properly, but soon, I started tailoring my magic around them, and my very fighting style. I found a master that would teach me to fight with weapons and I used my magic to enchant them. Then, after every fight, I’d just use my white magic to heal my wound. Like so…”

I demonstrate it by raising my hands in the air and making a white light appear all around him. As the light shines, my wounds start closing, and the blood fades away.

“The cutthroat’s knives had a life of their own, and there were many of them attacking me simultaneously. If I had a proper shield spell to defend against them, defeating him would have been child’s play. But defending against all those knives with a shield and sword alone would have been impossible regardless of my combat skill. All armors have their weaknesses. All he had to do was go for the armor’s joins repeatedly, until he wore me out.”

“Why are telling me all of this? Shouldn’t you be at least worried about revealing your greatest weakness to someone you just met?”

“Hey, you just saved my life! So you can’t be that bad, right?”

Besides, I know you aren’t asking me that, mister ‘not a stillwater’

“Pardon me for interrupting,” we hear a woman’s voice from behind the trees. “But would you by any chance be Daren, the legendary savior of the Eastern Continent?”

I look in the women’s direction and feel a chill go down my spine and start to think about my next actions carefully.
