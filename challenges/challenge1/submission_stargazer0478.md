The sun is bright, and the morning chill of the southern continent seeps into my bones. If it had not been for that open curtain, I would still be sleeping like a log.

I decided that it is time to get out of bed and head outside. As I get up, the fatigue from my previous adventure grinds me to a halt, as soon as I notice the piercing pain throughout my body, it disappears.

I should have known that my healing spells would not be enough this time. I cannot even remember what I was fighting and why, only that I was surrounded by monsters with my shield protecting something…No matter, I should find Sophie and see if she needs anything from me.

I changed to my tunic and leather pants, and head outside. By the time I got out, Sophie was right in front of me, hands behind her back, and exhausted, with a smile on her face.

“What were you doing out here Sophie?” I asked her.

“Nothing! Just some chores.” She answers, while trying to hide her smile.

Right, chores. I look around her and see gardening tools laying all over the floor, however the garden itself is untouched. Upon closer inspection, there are small holes and scrapes on the soil.

Sophie understands that I did not buy her excuse from earlier, and so she nervously takes a step back, now with a small smile.

“What are you hiding in your hands?” I ask her, “It better not be…”

“Okay, okay! Fine, you got me…” she says in a defeated tone, “I woke up 2 hours ago…”

There is a small pause, and she continues to say. “…I was training, with your sword.”

Again, she did it again. After I told her so many times that this blade cuts through rock like warm butter. Cuts through rock? For a moment a memory is about to emerge, but it is interrupted by Sophie’s next excuses.

“I can only train so much with shovels and sickles. I wanted to train with the real thing, I am sorry Daren.” she said, with an obviously fake pleading expression.

“Stop taking this so lightly Sophie! One wrong move with that sword, and you will be in grave danger.” I tell her, “What if something like that happens, and I am still sleeping?”

She looks at me briefly, and sighs.

“You’re right, I am truly sorry Daren.” She says, “It’s just that, I want to go with you when you leave tomorrow.”

Tomorrow? How does she know that I had plans to leave?

Before I get to ask, she pulls out a folded letter from her pocket. “I found this in your other trousers, while cleaning it yesterday.” She said calmly, “It says here that you will be joining a tournament in Varathia.”

“Oh, that.” I say.

I didn’t get the chance to tell her yesterday, because I fell asleep as soon as my head touched the bed.

She opens the letter and reads out loud, “Attention all mages and warriors. You are all hereby invited to a once in a lifetime event, to the mystical lands of Varathia. Compete against others for a chance to make your wildest dreams come true, through the power of the Magium.”

She looks in my eyes, and with a determined tone she says, “I am going to join this tournament alongside you. You know that I can take care of myself in a fight.”

“Sophie, are we talking about the same tournament?” I asked her. “You read it yourself, mages and warriors. Mages being the key word, what are you going to do against them? Run towards them in hopes you subdue them before they turn you into charcoal?” I stop briefly and continue, “Besides mages, there is bound to be some arrogant noble who joins with his small private army. What will you do if you are surrounded by a battalion of cutthroats and mercenaries? Will you be able to run away with your life? Oh, I know, the mighty undefeated Sophie of our glorious fighting pits would just annihilate them by throwing boulders and uprooting trees!” I stop to take a deep breath.

“Someone without magic, could never do such feats!” I say profusely. “I am sorry Sophie, but I am not about to let my wife just throw her life away.”

After hearing all I had to say, she tries to come up with a good enough excuse as to why she could come with. But ultimately, she could not.

“Fine, you made your point. I won’t drag this any further.” she says calmly, with a smile adorning her face. She then gives me my sword timidly, and softly kisses me on my lips.

I rest the sword beside the door and clean up the garden mess. I then headed inside and spent the rest of the day with Sophie.

The sun has now set behind the mountains in the west, I decided that now was a good time to prepare my gear for tomorrow. I polish my armour and use my small reserves of elven steel to reinforce it. Afterwards, I sharpen my sword and sheath it. Lastly, I do a quick inventory of my enchanting materials, my potions, and check my two tents for damage.

After no more than 40 minutes, I had finished my preparations and decided to lay down and think of strategies.

It is safe to assume that there will be combat involved at some point, but what if they have us wonder around Varathia? Not much is known about that continent, it has constantly closed borders and only allows people in with special invitations. There is no telling what kind of monsters and natural disasters plague that land. With all that being said, why would they suddenly allow so many people to compete? It said in the fine print that there will be a powerful spell in place, in order to prevent competitors from hurting the locals, and it also had a small mention that the winner of the Magium would also have to become Varathia’s champion. That must be it! They want the world’s mightiest mage as their personal guard, acting as a world class deterrent to would-be conquerors.

As I think deeply, the word Magium comes to mind.

The Magium… the world’s most mythical artifact. Legends say that he who wields it, will attain God like power, bending the world to his will. If I could get my hands on that artifact, my dream would finally come true. In a few hours I will be on Varathian soil, and I will have no choice but to win.

With those final thoughts, I drift into sleep.

## Arrival

My conviction has led me to this very moment, thousands of miles away from my home, from my love. My name is Daren, some call me “The Healer in Armour”, others call me “Hero”, but I am nothing so valiant, because for every person I save in a day, a thousand more die beyond my reach.

However, I finally have a real shot at saving them all. After winning this tournament, I will be granted access to the Magium and with it, I will put an end to world hunger, I will destroy pestilence and war, I will rid this world of those who would prey on the weak.

The catch? The winner must also become this continent’s champion, a loyal soldier to be teleported into battle at a moment’s notice. But that won’t matter, for there won’t be any wars left to fight when I am done here.

There are sounds of fighting coming from all around this area, don’t those mages understand that the organizers never said we should fight each other in this round? I should find a safe place where I can fix this damned transceiver, I need to tell Sophie that I made it safe to Varathia.

  

## Blade and Magic

If I did not know the situation, I would have sworn there is a castle under siege beyond that tree line due south. The number of explosions going off, and the magical energy I sense means that another group of mages have engaged in mindless fighting once again.

In any case, I do not sense anyone coming towards my location for now. I should figure out why my transceiver won’t reach Sophie. I spot a few boulders a few feet away from me and take a seat on the one most suited for my height.

As I sit on the boulder, I take off my enchanted backpack and visualize my enchanting toolkit. After taking my tools out of the backpack, I close it and wear it once more. Now with my tools ready and one of my transceivers in my hand, I am ready to begin.

It has been 30 minutes since I started examining my transceiver for damage, it seems that all my transceivers communicate with each other without issue. Which means, no damage happened during my teleportation to Varathia. So why can’t I contact Sophie? Distance should not be a problem, I made sure I could use them for reaching across the world if needed.

As I sit on the cold, hard rock, I begin to ponder on the possibility of interference. Could it be? Is there something near me that blocks my signal beyond the continent? Maybe it is the teleportation area’s fault, I am still just a couple miles away from it after all.

“Well, that’s enough sitting around.” I say to myself, and I put my tools back in the backpack while simultaneously getting up from the boulder. Just by standing up, I realize how uncomfortable I was for the past 30 minutes. I guess that is what I get from sitting for so long while wearing this unbearable armour.

I look around to get my bearings and after recognizing the direction of the teleportation area, I march the opposite way, in hopes of getting away from this interference.

It has been maybe 10 minutes of uninterrupted walking through these woods, and I spot what seems to be the end of it. After a few more steps I sense a mage’s aura, I see a young mage wearing a brown pair of linen pants, a linen tunic seemingly exactly tailored for his thin build and a beige cloak hanging from his shoulders. He seems to be holding a brass staff, and is headed for the clearing ahead.

As soon as I looked at the mage closer, I instinctively reached for my sword, gripping it strongly. Something is wrong here, in all my years of adventuring my body has never reacted this way to a scrawny mage like him.

I decided to keep my distance and observe him. As I concentrate on his aura, I make the daunting realization that there are in fact two auras in front of me. Someone is hiding up ahead somewhere, could he be behind those trees? He could even be invisible. Gods be damned, this feeling I have been getting since I spotted this kid, someone is lurking here, and I sense it won’t end well for the poor lad.

Just as I was about to run towards him and raise a barrier with my shield, I see a shadow emerging from behind a tree close to the mage, and as soon as I spot him, I shout to the mage.

“Behind you! Get away from that tree!”, I shouted. Upon hearing my warning, the young mage is taken by surprise and stumbles on an up-grounded root, causing him to trip and fall to the grassy ground. Luck is on his side it seems, for he had just narrowly dodged a flying dagger that penetrated 5 inches into the tree he was in front of.

While I am sprinting towards the empty space between the mage and his enemy, the latter starts cursing loudly, “I was about to pin that moron’s head to the log, you damn churl! Mind your own business!”. Just as he was finished, I had made my way between them, sword in arm and with my shield raised.

I turn to the boy and say, “Unless you want to fight alongside me, I suggest you start running.” The mage hastily tries to get up while I raise my shield to block a dagger flying towards me.

Just as it was about to hit my shield in its center, it rapidly changed direction, going around me and flying towards the mage. I barely manage to deflect it with my sword and shout, “Go! Now!”

This time the mage manages to get up and runs through the forest away from the two of us. Now, what do I do with this one? I certainly don’t want to spill blood so soon after arriving to Varathia, but I certainly cannot simply let this man go. He has already proven his malicious intent by trying to murder that boy. Besides, those flying daggers changing direction like that, he is a mage himself.

There is a small moment of silence, as we stare each other down. I can clearly see now, this scoundrel is also dressed the part. Rugged leather pants, a worn white shirt with what seems to be dried blood stains, and a leather belt holding about a dozen throwing knives, and half a dozen engraved daggers. In addition to that, he has a merciless stare to go along with the rest of his looks.

“I suggest you throw down your knives and surrender.” I tell him sharply, “I do not want to have to kill you, if you simply surrender and take an enchanter’s oath to not hurt anyone in the tournament unless for your own protection or if the objectives demand so, I will be willing to let you walk. What do you say?”

Then mage’s vicious stare loosens, and he starts to laugh out loud. “You will let me go, you said?” he says while trying to speak and laugh at the same time.

In just a moment he stops laughing and shouts, “filthy cur, do not think for a moment you will leave alive from this forest!” he takes a deep breath and shouts once more, “When I’m done with you, you will have so many knives in your back, you will look like an archer porcupine!”

Before I get to respond, three flying daggers go straight for my throat. I quickly take a jump to the left dodging the first one, while parrying the next with my sword. The last one turns downwards fast, aiming for the gap between the steel plates protecting my ankle. But I block it by crouching with my shield raised. By the time I looked at him again, he had begun running towards the clearing.

I would be willing to bet that his plan is to lure me in an open space and kill me with a barrage of knives. However, he does not strike me as the forward thinking short. I suspect he will deplete his supply of throwing knives quickly, and then he will only have his flying daggers left.

Try to close distance while parrying and blocking.

As I enter the clearing, my enemy is about 100 feet away from me and I have no means of ranged combat, my priority should be to close the distance between us and hopefully end this fight with no fatalities.

Two more daggers fly for my head, but I easily block them by raising my shield. Immediately afterwards, I lower my body and make a powerful sprint with my shield protecting me from waist to head. Half a dozen daggers bounce off my shield, and a few more bounce right off the steel protecting my thighs and sheens, leaving nothing more than scratches.

After about 40 feet, my left eye catches a glimpse of a swerving dagger, reflecting sunlight briefly. This is exactly what I was waiting for, he may have an intimidating personality, but as a mage he is nothing to write home about.

Just as predicted, he already wasted all his regular throwing knives and is now using his enchanted daggers.

I plant my feet and grind my momentum to a halt, sliding for a small distance on the soil while simultaneously rotating my torso to the left, blocking the dagger effectively. As it bounces off, it picks up speed again and starts on a different trajectory after a few seconds.

By that time, my opponent had already thrown 2 more daggers that swerve in different trajectories. For the next minute or so, I maintain my defensive stance to successfully defend myself against the three daggers that relentlessly attack my blind spots.

Think about the limitations of heavy armour and the basic version of the shield spell

If I had been wearing a helmet, I would have died 5 times by now. I think I may have underestimated my opponent’s strength. He may be predictable, but his control over the flying daggers is impressive, I just hope he cannot control more than 4 at a time.

“Damn it.” I say to myself, as I think of my predicament.

This would never have happened if those daggers of his had been magically created. I could have just used my shield spell, and this fight would have been over in minutes. Additionally, if it weren’t for my unusually weak defensive magic against physical attacks, I would not even have to wear this encumbering armour.

To think all those years spent learning those fancy moves from master Nolderan would go to waste over something like this… deficiency.

Have more mages that fight each other enter the clearing so it becomes chaotic

My train of thought gets immediately interrupted, as I realize that the daggers have stopped their assault. In fact, my opponent had completely lost his focus on me, and hurryingly pulled all his daggers in a defensive orbit around him, all the while taking a low stance and looking to the west.

Suddenly, the ground shakes violently and a rock golem rushes out towards us, with what appears to be a mage sprinting away from it. He makes a big jump off the ground by propelling himself with wind magic, sending a booming sound towards us.

Then, in an impressive air maneuver, he rotates himself in midair, doing a fast slapping motion to the air in front of himself.

The golem was in the middle of a hurdling sprint, when its head burst to the side, shattered in pieces. Judging by how easily the golem was defeated by what is essentially a slap from the weakest element, it would be safe to assume that it was hastily created by an earth elementalist, rather than it being a summoned elemental.

However, that elementalist still has not shown himself. If they were to create a stronger golem while they are hiding and cut it loose here, I would not be able to manage a fight with both the golem and that cutthroat.

Luckily for me, the earth elementalist showed himself immediately after the golem’s body turned to rubble.

He is a middle-aged man with a heavy braided beard. He wears common mage’s robes with a chainmail hauberk over them.

“I thought air elementalists were prideful mages!” the mage shouts, “But all you’ve done since we started this duel, is running and flying away. Like a coward!”

The air elementalist instead of answering, enters a stance and prepares for battle, with a determined look on his face. Seeing that, the earth elementalist shouts, “Now that’s more like it! That is how mages should fight!”

The four of us are now standing 60 feet away from each other. This is a bad situation to be in so early in the tournament but at least my position favors my abilities, the earth elementalist is to my shield’s side, which means I will be able to block most of his attacks with my shield, especially if he decided to use magically created earth. While the air elementalist is on my sword hand’s side, and if my reflexes are faster, I will be able to absorb all his spells with my sword’s enchantments. Lastly, that cutthroat is immediately in front of me, and in this predicament, he remains the most dangerous for me, although he does look exhausted for some reason.

Continue fight with dave, while also blocking and dodging stray projectiles and environmental hazards from the other fight

On the one hand the air elementalist looks at the two of us in turn and then locks his eyes on his original enemy. On the other hand, the earth elementalist completely ignores us, grins and elevates himself on a slab of earth. Almost simultaneously the air elementalist casts a spell that makes his body levitate higher with each second, the air around his looks distorted.

Suddenly I get the instinct to dodge, and I immediately do so, narrowly dodging a dagger aimed for the back of my head. He must have sneakily navigated one of the daggers into the forest and around the clearing, to catch me by surprise.

The dagger spins violently and starts to gain altitude. Almost as if it was a starting mark, the two elementalists engaged in combat.

The earth elementalist began by throwing 3 large naturals boulders that were laying around, all the while creating new ones suspended around him. In response, the air elementalist easily dodged the first 2 by simply flying around them, and completely destroyed the last with what seemed to be highly condensed wind magic

I decided to rush towards my target before he gets the chance to do any other sneak attacks. But my plan fell apart, because I was once again under a barrage of flying daggers. I keep defending as before, but this time he sent a fourth dagger, making this fight excruciatingly difficult.

In my desperate attempt to defend my weak points, the entire clearing starts to shake as 2 massive rock golems emerge from the ground and immediately began hurdling towards the flying mage. To which in response, he created a tornado in between them, slowing them down.

This gave me much needed rest, as the tornado was large enough to send small rocks all around the clearing, with one knocking my enemy flat on his ass. An opportunity like this cannot be wasted, so I dash as fast as I can towards a pair of daggers close enough to me, dodging a few stray rock projectiles on the way. I planted my sword to the ground, grabbed my enchanted backpack, and shoved the daggers in. I tried to do the same to the other two, but a flying boulder made the air elementalist lose focus, making the tornado wander for a moment. That was enough time for my enemy’s daggers to be carried away by the air currents.

However, this worked well enough for me, “Good luck getting those back, friend!” I shouted, but I got no response. There is no way he got knocked out by that right?

Enchanted backpacks are essentially pocket dimensions, and mine has several security enchantments on top. He will not be able to remove them no matter what. I then put on my backpack, picked up my sword again, and I decided to hold my ground. Right now, I am not casting any spells, and I have plenty of energy to spare. However, my adversary has had to resort to magically altering his daggers movements constantly for quite a few minutes. There are two daggers in my pack, two daggers dispersed on the ground at random by the tornado, and from what I can tell he has another two remaining on him.

The best part? Between me and him, there is a maelstrom of destruction. One of the two golems just got its head twisted off by another ‘slap’ of wind, while the other one is currently engulfed in the tornado. The air elementalist extended his right arm towards the forest, and an incredibly large gust of wind bent the trees towards him, while the air started collecting right above his hand. The earth elementalist began to erupt large pillars of stone, with hopes of disrupting the airflow of the tornado, and at the same time manifest a reinforced rock shield for his golem.

With all this happening between the two of us, my enemy is laying face first in a patch of mud, with his white shirt now being covered in dirt.

A few seconds later, two stray boulders flew towards me. But I effortlessly cut both with a swing of my blade. I am going to have to hold my position, maybe I will get the chance to persuade them to stop the fight.

Another minute passes with me regaining my physical stamina, while my enemy starts to regain consciousness. Unfortunately, as soon as my strategy was about to pay out, the giant golem had freed itself and was now holding the big rock shield its master prepared for it. The golem made its way back to its creator with the shield raised towards the air elementalist, who had created a ball of condensed air twice as big as his head. Furthermore, that ball of air was so condensed, it almost seemed opaque.

The air elementalist’s face was red and had veins popping all over. What’s more, his exposed arms were showing signs of extreme stress, as all the fat had seemed to be converted into energy, revealing an impressive muscular physique covered by raging currents of wind.

In almost an instant, he flew towards the shield wielding golem, stopped a few inches away from it, and grinned with a pained expression. What happened next was simply unheard of, a mage specializing in the element of wind, the most ridiculed element in the world, would soon imprint the appropriate respect for it in my heart.

He moved the opaque ball of air in front of his chest, extended his arms in front of himself almost converging to a point with a small upward angle, and released all the air he had gathered. What he had essentially created was a funnel for his attack, a guiding rail of annihilation.

The rest of the attack happened in a glimpse, and my eyes were barely able to perceive it. The sheer amount of force that hit the golem head on was enough to shatter its shield, instantly fusing the rubble to the rest of the golem in magma. The explosion that ensued next completely blew away the now semi-melted golem along with its master. In addition to that, it was enough to break the arms of the air mage, all the while sending him in the opposite direction, crashing through several trees deep into the forest. There is just no way any of them survived.

Final climax with dave

As for the two of us, the shockwave threw him a dozen feet backwards. But I was much closer in addition to standing on my feet, the explosion threw me into the forest, miraculously between the trees, with my momentum minimized by bushes and thin tree branches. The sonic element of the explosion did not bypass my passive spell against sonic attacks, so my eardrums were completely unharmed. However, I was hit by several large pieces from the first golem that were blown off by the explosion, making me think that I had broken a few ribs. If it were not for this bulky enchanted armor, I would be in pieces right about now.

“I guess you’re not so bad…” I say in an almost silent tone, while casting first aid spells to my torso and head.

Even though I am still hurt, I manage to get up and realize that I am in yet another clearing. My sword is laying a few feet away from me, so I decided to run as I could to pick it up.

To my surprise, I heard footsteps as soon as I picked it up. I turn around frantically to see the face of my previous enemy. It seems he is literally unharmed from everything that happened. What’s more, he has a confused expression and stumbles a bit with each step.

Looks like that rock got him good, he doesn’t even know what is happening.

“You! Wretch!” he shouts to me, “What a disappointment you turned out to be! I was mopping the floor with you and that brass staff moron, and you flew away like a coward!”

What is he rumbling about? Did he really forget about that explosion? I can still see the dust cloud from here, and did he say flew? There is no way he thinks I’m an air elementalist.

His memory is messed up, temporary or not. He seems to still want a fight.

“Now, now, I think you hurt your head pretty bad.” I told him, “How about you go take a rest, and we continue this later?”

There is just no way I win this, as I am now. I didn’t get the chance to properly heal myself.

“Like hell I am!” he shouts angrily, “I got you right here, don’t I?”

He pauses for a second and starts looking attentively at my face. “You…” he says slowly.

“You are the hero, Daren, are you not?”, he says with a wicked smile before shouting, “You weakling!”

He then began overwhelming my defenses with all four of his magic daggers, while also mixing in throwing knives he seems to have picked up from our previous battleground.

It doesn’t take long for me to misread a dagger and get stabbed in between my armor. From there on, I was increasingly getting more tired and hurt with each second, until I dropped to one knee. My enemy has sheathed all his daggers and is now grinning with a wicked smile.

Here it comes, the usual ‘victory’ speech, cutthroats usually do when they mercilessly beat someone.

## To entertain doubt is to dance with death

"The legendary mage Daren! The savior of the Eastern Continent. The healer in armor. They say you've travelled the world, saving countless villages from destruction. That you've once fought ten rock golems by yourself, only to defend a small child.”, as he said that I suddenly remember what my previous adventure was all about.

I was protecting a small kid that got stuck in the deep mud, man those golems were definitely reinforced with metal, that clobbering I got to the head made me forget all about it. I guess we are alike in that regard, aren’t we?

“I guess this goes to show, you should never really trust legends, aye? I always knew all of those tales about mages as strong as giants were just codswallop. Hell, if all those 'legendary' mages that joined this tournament are as weak as you, I'm going to win this by sundown!"

I sure would love for that air elementalist to be somehow alive, just to see this idiots face in a duel with him.

He starts to laugh arrogantly, but suddenly stops and says, “Wait, who’s there?”

He turns to face a tree behind him. "I know you're there, coward. Show yourself, or I'll have one of my knives find you!", he said.

A few moments later, a young man in what seems to be his late twenties had begun to slowly walk away from the tree and towards him, and with a calm demeanor he asks, “Who are you calling a coward?”.

I can tell the cutthroat is afraid, his fingers are trembling, and he soon proves me right by the tremble in his voice.

“A Stillwater, eh?”

No wonder he is doubting himself, this man in front of him has basically no magic aura, a characteristic only mages that hold the title ‘Stillwater’ can have.

He then overcomes his trembling voice and proclaims, "You don't scare me, stillwater! I'm going to fill you with holes and you'll end up begging me for mercy! I bet your legends are no more true than they were for this sad excuse for a mage standing next to me.", while unsheathing two of his daggers.

“That’s funny,” said the man. “That's almost the same thing the people of Olmnar told me. Before I burned their city to the ground."

Olmnar? Is that a Varathian city? Whoever this guy is, he might be bad news. Destroying an entire city? And did he just insinuate he did it by himself?

“You’re bluffing,” the cutthroat said.

"I guess there's only one way to find out, then," said the stillwater.

And after a long pause, the cutthroat concedes, saying. “You're in luck, stillwater. I'm feeling merciful today. I'm going to be out of your hair just as soon as I finish this guy here."

"You do that and you'll regret it," said the young stillwater, making the cutthroat confused.

"What, are you kidding me? You're going to defend this lowlife?"

"If I have to. Do I have to?"

The cutthroat is now silent with sweat running down his palms.

"I'll remember this, stillwater. Don't think I won't. I never forget a face. You'll rue the day you messed with Cutthroat Dave. And the same goes for you, healer in armor. I'll be seeing the both of you again soon." Said the cutthroat while sheathing his daggers and then spits next to me.

This man, I completely misread him. He would put his own self in harm’s way, just to save some stranger. I made up my mind, I will offer him my shield.

"You had no obligation to save me," he says. "But you did so anyway, at the risk of your own life. I cannot let such selflessness go unrewarded. I, Daren, vow this day that I will offer you my protection from this moment, and until the end of this tournament. Tell me, brave soul, what is your name?" I say in my professional tone.

The stillwater looks at me with a surprised look and says, “It’s, uhh… It’s Barry. My name is Barry.”

Barry? Did he say Barry?

“Wait, your name's Barry?"

I tried to contain my laughter, but it was too late.

I calm down a bit and say, "Now that's the weirdest name for a mage I've heard in my life. Especially for a stillwater. Do you have something you want to tell me, Barry?"

He looks at me and tells me, "I'm not a stillwater, Daren. That thug just assumed I was and I took advantage of the situation."

"But you're not one of the locals either. Otherwise that spell of theirs would have alerted us the moment we sensed your presence." I told him.

Cunning bastard, in that case he must be a participant.

"So you must be a participant, then," I said. "What reason would you have to participate in a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world?"

There is a small pause, but I ask him again. "Why did you join this tournament, Barry?"

"I'm after the same thing as you, Daren," he tells me. "I'm after the Magium. It's been my dream ever since I was little to become a mage, and the Magium can grant me that wish."

That is an obvious lie. What kind of lunatic would actually do that?

“Come on, Barry. You're going to have to make up a better lie than that if you want me to believe you!" I told him.

I then looked into his eyes, he had a determined look, a bit too determined.

“By the gods… You are being serious! Barry, I commend your bravery and determination but... You do realize you can't win this entire tournament just by bluffing, don't you?" I told him in disbelief.

"Of course I know that! That's not the only ace I have up my sleeve. But what about you? They say you are one of the strongest mages in the world. So how does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave?" he said.

“Oh, that…”

Oh no, how do I even explain this to him? He is a regular guy, I cannot just tell him that I got hammered by another mage’s spell without even being the target! What should I say? Maybe I’ll just tell him about the shield spell, and just tell the story as how Dave saw it, yes that’s it!

"You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn't mean I don't have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly..."

"The shield spell? The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself? But isn't that one of the first spells any mage learns?" he said.

"It is... But it's not like I can't cast it at all... I can defend from magic just fine. It's normal weapons that I have a problem with. This is why I wear armor. This is why I use a sword and a shield. I first started using them because I couldn't use the shield spell properly, but soon, I started tailoring my magic around them, and my very fighting style. I found a master that would teach me to fight with weapons, and I used my magic to enchant them. Then, after every fight, I'd just use my white magic to heal my wounds. Like so..."

I guess now is a good time to heal my wounds from the crash.

I then raise my hands in the air and a bright light shines on me, closing my wounds slowly.

"The cutthroat's knives had a life of their own, and there were many of them attacking me simultaneously. If I had a proper shield spell to defend against them, defeating him would have been child's play. But defending against all those knives with a shield and sword alone would have been impossible regardless of my combat skill. All armors have their weaknesses. All he had to do was go for the armor's joints repeatedly, until he wore me out."

That should satisfy his curiosity, please don’t delve in.

"Why are you telling me all of this? Shouldn't you be at least a bit worried about revealing your greatest weakness to someone you just met?"

Thank the gods!

"Hey, you just saved my life! So you can't be that bad, right?" I told him.

After that, we hear a woman’s voice from behind the trees, "Pardon me for interrupting," she said. "But would you by any chance be Daren, the legendary savior of the Eastern Continent?"
