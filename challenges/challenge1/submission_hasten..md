The Magium—the supposed source of all magic. Everyone claims it exists, but no one has ever truly seen it. Sometimes I wonder if I’m chasing a ghost, pursuing something intangible, but doubt won’t stop me. My goal is clear, and my determination is unshakable. I have to reach it, whatever it may be.

As things stand, my strength alone isn’t enough. I’ve tried to change the world and try to help, but there’s always more to do, and I’m always limited by my abilities. The suffering I’ve seen, the injustice—I can’t fix it all, not without more power or a powerful spell perhaps. That’s why I need the Magium. Winning this tournament is the only way to gain the strength I need to protect everything I care about and make the difference I’ve always dreamed of.

I’m Daren. I’m tall, bald, with weathered dark skin and a scar across my face—an X-shaped reminder of battles fought long ago. It stands out, no matter where I go, and people tend to fixate on it. I’ve learned to embrace it. It’s part of who I am, part of the path that led me here. I’m in my mid-40s now, not young, but not weak either. If anything, I’ve grown stronger over the years, though it’s never been easy. This tournament brings together the most powerful mages in the world, each one with their own ambitions, each one determined to win.

Despite everything I’ve learned, despite being trained by the best, my skills still have weaknesses. My defensive spells, in particular, are lacking. It’s why I rely on armor and a shield. They’re heavy, yes, and they slow me down, but they’ve saved my life more times than I can count. Magic alone isn’t enough to protect me, so I bring the armor—a constant reminder of my limitations, but also of my resourcefulness.

Before the tournament begins, I feel the need to reach out one last time. I pull out my transceiver, a device I always carry, and think of Sophie—my wife. We’ve been apart for so long that sometimes it feels strange to even imagine being with her again. We stay in touch, but the distance never gets easier. I’ve spent years traveling the world, helping where I can, and leaving her behind to wait.

How many years has it been? Not long after our wedding, I set out on this journey. I didn’t expect the marriage to withhold, honestly, I was planning to divorce in order to not leave Sophie the burden of worry about my well-being but Sohphie wanted to hear none of this, instead, she encouraged me to do what I wished to do. Leaving Sophie behind was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but staying wasn’t an option. I couldn’t ignore the suffering I saw, and she understood that. She always has.

After a short pause, her voice comes through the transceiver, warm and familiar.

“Daren?” she says, and just hearing her soft voice eases some of the tension in my chest.

“Hey, Sophie… it’s been a while,” I say, even though we spoke a few days ago. Time feels different now that the tournament is but moments away.

“A while? We talk every other day! Are you about to enter the tournament?” she asks, as perceptive as ever.

I smile despite myself. “Yeah, we’re about to be teleported. I might not be able to contact you for a while. I wanted to talk before... well before anything happens.”

“Daren, are you still worried about leaving me alone?” Her tone shifts, firm but understanding. She’s always known me too well.

“We’ve talked about this. I know who I married, and I know how long it might take for you to come back. Stop worrying about what we can’t control. Focus on what you’re doing now. Isn’t there something else you should say?”

I pause, then let out a breath. “I’ll win, Sophie. I’ll come back with the prize. Wait for me.”

She laughs softly, the sound like a balm. “You’re always so sure of yourself. Just be sure to come back. We’ve got something to celebrate when you do.”

“I can’t wait to—"

Before I can finish, the magic of the tournament pulls me away. My body feels weightless, my vision blurring as I’m transported. When my senses return, I’m standing in the middle of a dense forest—the tournament grounds.

“Sophie? Sophie?” I try calling out through the transceiver, but there’s no response. Either it’s broken, or the magic in this place is interfering. No matter—this is it. The tournament has begun.

I take in my surroundings. No sign of the other participants—they’ve been teleported elsewhere. I’m alone. I wait for an announcement to signal the first trial, but the forest remains eerily quiet. Instead of standing idle, I decided to head toward the distant sounds of voices, my shield ready, senses on high alert.

As I approach the noise, it’s clear that some participants have already begun fighting. Spells light up the forest, and explosions echo through the trees. Magic crackles in the air as rival mages clash, their power evident even from a distance.

“Why are they fighting already? The event hasn’t even started,” I mutter to myself, shaking my head. It’s reckless to waste energy now, but some people can’t resist the temptation of an early fight.

A few participants recognize me, their eyes widening in fear. The “Healer in Armor” has a reputation, it seems. They steer clear, giving me space. That suits me just fine—I don’t want to waste energy before the real challenges begin.

But even as I avoid confrontation, it bothers me. I came here to protect, to grow strong enough to make a difference. How can I ignore this senseless fighting? Yet, I know I must conserve my strength. I have priorities—Sophie is waiting, and I can’t risk failing now.

Soon enough, someone steps forward to challenge me. A man, unimpressive in appearance, strides into view. He’s wearing worn leather pants and a dirty shirt, with a belt full of knives. His eyes light up when he spots me, his excitement clear.

“You’re Daren, right? The mage?” he asks, his tone dripping with malice.

I nod. “That’s right. And who are you?”

“Cutthroat Dave. I’m not here to talk. I’m here for your head.”

I sigh. “I’ve seen plenty of people fighting already, but none were foolish enough to come at me with knives. I suggest you leave while you can—”

Before I can finish, a dagger flies straight at me. I block it with my shield just in time.

“You talk too much! Show some strength, healer!” Dave shouts, throwing more knives. I block them easily, but something feels off. One of the knives floats unnaturally, and I realize too late that he’s controlling them with magic.

This complicates things. A simple shield spell would be enough to counter him, but I was never able to use it to block actual weapons. I raise my shield to cover my exposed areas, but his knives keep coming. He’s targeting the joints in my armor, trying to wear me down.

“What’s wrong, hero? Are all your stories just that—stories? Fight me!” he taunts, grinning as his knives continue their assault.

I retreat into the forest, using the dense trees for cover. It disrupts his magic, buying me time to heal my wounds. I try to ambush him, but he’s quick, dodging my attacks and creating more distance.

Fatigue starts to set in. His magic is simple but effective. I realize my only option is to outlast him. Controlling so many knives must be draining his energy, and if I can hold out, he’ll exhaust himself.

I keep moving, using the forest to my advantage. With each step, I get closer, blocking his attacks with my shield and healing as I go. These are the kinds of fights that my armor gets me at a disadvantage not to mention the fatigue. The closer I get, the more opportunities to get injured in the process but these long-duration fights are prone to mistakes. His blades have spread out, leaving an opening, controlling so many simultaneously was careless of him, I lunge forward, using the trees as cover, and close the distance before slamming my shield to his chest. Something felt unnatural, I surely hit him but it was light, he managed to diminish the strength of the shield by dodging. I try to swing my sword to finish the fight before he manages to escape but one of his blades slices across my arm and I am unable to finish the attack properly. Am exhausted, at this point this was my last attempt to turn the tables around, now even if I do manage to close the gap, I don’t have enough stamina, speed, or strength to land a hit. Eventually, I collapse to the ground trying to patch my wounds with magic while catching my breath. Dave on the other hand walks up triumphantly with a satisfied grin on his face as a predator about to devour his prey.

“The legendary mage Daren! The savior of the Eastern Continent. The leader in armor. They say you’ve traveled the world, saving countless villages from destruction. That you’ve once fought ten rock golems by yourself, only to defend a small child.”

Dave announces as if for the world to hear, he doesn’t even look at me while speaking. I try to reach for my sword while he is distracted, searching, maybe even hoping for anything to help me escape this situation. Trees, bushes, a poorly hidden civilian, sounds of distant magic explosions and fighting, wait… a civilian?

“I guess this goes to show, that you should never really trust legends, aye? I always knew all of those tales about mages as strong as giants were just codswallop. Hell if all those “legendary” mages that joined this tournament are as weak as you, I’m going to win this by sundown!” Dave continues.

While Dave is still celebrating am worried about the civilian that is in the woods. When we entered the tournament a spell was cast that prevented us from hurting the locals of the continent but even so, the credibility that it would work in any kind of situation is not certain. Dave apparently finally had a look at me which was focused on another direction.

“Wait, who’s there?” he says as he spots the hidden civilian.

“I know you are there, coward. Show yourself, or I’ll have my knives find you!”

With his intents clear, I try to heal my wounds and gather some strength, I grab my shield in a tight hold and my sword only a few inches away. Before I could stand back up though unexpectedly, instead of running away, the unknown civilian just appeared in open view.

“Who are you calling a coward?” he says as he appears.

“A stillwater, eh?”

That tittle resonates with my memory, stillwaters, are incredibly powerful mages, rumors say that one managed to destroy an entire city with ease, the problem is that they can not be distinguished from humans. Mages have an aura around them, not only revealing that they are mages, but also their approximate strength. While many can and will suppress their aura, stillwaters need no such thing. If the man in front of us is indeed one of them, the danger he possesses is greater than Dave at the moment, and it shows especially with the tremor in his voice.

“You don’t scare me stillwater! I’m going to fill you with holes and you’ll end up begging me for mercy! I bet your legends are no more true than they were for this sad excuse for a mage standing next to me.”

You utter moron… this is not the time to act strong and mighty, your instincts say otherwise it would be good to listen to them.

“That’s funny, that’s almost the same thing the people of Olmnar told me. Before I burned their city to the ground.” The stillwater announces.

“Your bluffing”

“I guess there is only one way to find out, then.”

Us three have been staring each other in silence in what felt like the longest seconds of my life. The only thing that at the moment was keeping me calm was the fact that he still did not attack us. If he was indeed as powerful as he said would he even give us the time of day to hold a conversation? This thought gave me the impression that the stillwater is actually here to help me.

“You’re in luck, stillwater. I’m feeling merciful today. I’m going to be out of your hair just as soon as I finish this guy here”

“You do that and you’ll regret it”

“What, are you kidding me? You’re going to defend this lowlife?” says dave completely baffled by the remark.

“If I have to. Do I have to?”

After a growl, Cutthroat Dave seems to give up on the idea, instead, he picks up his remaining knives and makes his leave.

“I’ll remember this, still water. Don’t think I won’t. I never forget a face. You’ll rue the day you messed with Cutthroat Dave. And the same goes for you, healer in armor. I’ll be seeing the both of you again soon.”

Honestly, scared as he was am not sure I will ever see him again, which is probably for the best. Nonetheless, this kindhearted person went out of his way to help me. He said he was the one who destroyed Olmar, but am having a hard time believing that now. Unlike one with such strength who would most likely ignore this fight, yet alone interfere out of his own free will and even help? Alright, I made a decision, this might not have been part of my original plan while in this tournament, but I can’t be ungrateful.

“You had no obligation to save me, but you did so anyway, at the risk of your own life. I cannot let suck selflessness go unrewarded. I, Daren, vow this day that I will offer you my protection from this moment, and until the end of this tournament. Tell me, brave soul, what is your name?”

“It’s, uhh… It’s Barry, My name is Barry.”

“Wait, your name’s Barry?”

From this already eventful day this must be the weirdest thing I hear all day. My original deductions might be actually correct.

“Now that’s the weirdest name for a mage I’ve heard in my life. Especially for a stillwater. Do you have something to tell me, Barry?”

A few seconds had passed, the man named Barry seemed to be collecting his thoughts trying to arrive at a decision.

“I’m not a stillwater, Daren. That thug just assumed I was and I took advantage of the situation.”

“But you’re not one of the locals either. Otherwise that spell of their presence.”

Seems my intuition was correct, if he is no mage or a civilian, he’s probably here not for the Magium. Even though I already made up my mind to protect him, his goals may put both of us into difficult situations so I need to know beforehand about our goals.

“So you must be a participant, then. What reason would you have to participate in a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world?”

“I’m after the same thing as you, Daren. I’m after the Magium. It’s been my dream ever since I was little to become a mage, and the Magium can grant me that wish.”

“Come on, Barry. You’re going to have to make a better lie than that if you want me to believe you!” So I said, but his look is unwavering.

“By the gods… You are being serious!”

“Barry, I commend your bravery and determination but… You do realize you can’t win this entire tournament just by bluffing, don’t you?”

“Of course I know that! That’s not the only ace I have up my sleeve. But what about you? They say you are one of the strongest mages in the world. So how does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave?”

“Oh, that… You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly…”

“The shield spells?” he asks me with confusion on his eyes.

“The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself? But isn’t that one of the first spells any mage learns?” he asks with a confused look on his expression.

“It is… But it’s not like I can’t cast it at all… I can defend from magic just fine. It’s normal weapons that I have a problem with. This is why I wear armor. This is why I use a sword and a shield. I first started using them because I couldn’t use the spell properly, but soon, I started tailoring my magic and fighting style on them. I found a master that would teach me to fight with weapons, and I used my magic to enchant them. Then, after every fight, I’d just use my white magic to heal my wounds. Like so…”

I used my healing magic to heal a small cut I had on my arm to demonstrate. I used it so much during my confrontation with Cutthroat that am unsure how long I can last if anyone else decides to engage us.

“The cutthroat’s knives had a life on their own, and there were many of them attacking me simultaneously. If I had a proper shield spell to defend, defeating him would be a child’s play. But defending against all of those knives with a shield and a sword alone would have been impossible regardless of my combat skill. All armors have their weaknesses. All he had to do was go for the armor’s joints repeatedly and I was worn out.

“Why are you telling me all of this? Shouldn’t you be at least worried about revealing your greatest weakness to someone you just met?”

“Hey, you just saved my life! So you can’t be that bad, right?”

Grateful as I am we need to build some trust between us. His way of thinking is correct, but I doubt he has any ill intentions, maybe even more he may be willing to assist, if he can that is. My instincts tell me he won’t backstab me as he was so willing to help me while being powerless.

That small moment of peace since I entered the tournament, unfortunately, did not last long as a person walked towards us, coming from the woods.

“Pardon me for interrupting, but would you by any chance be Daren, the legendary savior of the Eastern Continent?”
