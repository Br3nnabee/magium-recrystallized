It's been so long. I don't even remember when I started out on this journey. I can't say that it has been a fulfilling one, there is always so much pain and suffering and misery wherever I have gone, yet I still continue to do my best to save as many people as I can.

As I stand in this unfamiliar forest, I can't help but be anticipated. What I've looked for all this time finally seems to be in reach. A way to save not as many as possible, but everyone that needs to be saved.

There have always been people that need to be saved, there have always been people who save them. I am sure many would consider me one of the latter. I am Daren, though many would likely know me as the healer in armor.

The sound of distant explosions bring me back to the problem at hand. I can sense a man walking towards me.  

By all means, he looks like a common, run-of-the-mill thug, but h has a belt full of knives. This might be problematic.

"Healer in armor, it is an honor to meet you." He says before I can say anything. I ready myself for battle, his words don't have an ounce of respect. Clearly, to him, I am just another ordinary mage he needs to cut down.

No chance for peace, huh?

A quick whoosh.

I block the knife coming at me from behind with my shield. Another one flies towards me, but it is easy to deflect it.

The man wielding enchanted knives, or rather, the thug and I are facing off in a clearing. He throws most of his blades that move with their own will and directs them at me with expert control. The knives dart unpredictably, each one finding a path to test my defenses.

I am, although protected by my armor and wielding a sword and shield, still vulnerable. I continue using my shield to deflect the incoming knives and sword to parry those that slip through. I maintain my strength, focusing on staying defensive while I seek an opportunity to turn the tide.

As the fight progresses, my tactical defense begins to pay off. My shield blocks the most dangerous attacks, while my sword does the others. I methodically deflect and counter the knives' strikes, waiting for the right moment to launch a counterattack.

The turning point arrives long after the battle started, when the thug, noticing that the knives’ attacks are being increasingly blocked and countered, becomes more aggressive, perhaps bored of how long it is taking. The knives start to converge on me, aiming to overwhelm me with a rapid, synchronized assault. Despite the my best efforts to defend, the intensity of the knife attacks begins to erode my defenses. I think I might lose.

In a critical moment, the knives converge with overwhelming precision. My shield, though strong, is breached by a coordinated flurry, and the knives find their way through gaps in my armor. Unable to keep up with the relentless barrage, I am struck with a series of critical blows.

The fight concludes with the knife-wielder triumphing, having successfully exploited the momentary lapses in the warrior’s defenses. The once-imposing armored figure falls, overcome by the relentless, precise attacks of the enchanted knives.

I wish I could use the Shield spell right now. It would have been far easier to end this fight. It is the one weakness I have. A simple spell that protects you from physical attacks, and I, one who uses a sword and shield, can not cast it. Laughable, is it not?

It isn't even a fight, it is simply a beatdown. I have lost, just like that. That's not to say that I did not try my best, yet this outcome was inevitable.

To think that, I would join a tournament where the world's strongest would participate, lose against a common thug. Truly laughable.

And as if my self-pity wasn't enough. "The legendary mage Daren! The savior of the Eastern continent. The healer in armor. They say you've travelled the world, saving countless villages from destruction. They say you've once fought ten rock golems by yourself, only to defend a small child." Well, there were actually, eleven. "I guess this goes to show, you should never really trust legends, aye? I always knew all of those tales about mages as strong as giants were just codswallop. Hell, if all those 'legendary' mages that joined this tournament are as weak as you, I'm going to win this by sundown!"

He starts laughing but stops suddenly. He turns from me, "Wait, who's there?" He asks, looking towards a particular tree. I was too focused to notice that a third party is present, watching us.

"I know you're there, coward. Show yourself, or I'll have one of my knives find you!"

After a couple of tension filled moments, a man steps forward. His calm demeanor surprises me. I say man, not mage, because the aura he is exuding is not the same as that of a mage. It is that of an ordinary man. But, would an ordinary man join this tournament? Surely, nobody would be insane enough to do that, that would be nothing short of suicide. But, then, could he possibly be...

"A stillwater, eh?" The thug says. I can hear how nervous he is, for I am feeling the same. Stillwaters and ordinary folks have the same amount of magic flowing from their bodies. That is to say, their 'auras' are not much different.

Stillwaters are known to be incredibly powerful mages. One of them is said to have destroyed an entire city in an instant about twenty years ago, that too, with just a flick of his finger. A city, not small in any regard, wiped out from the map.

And one such user of magic stands before us.

"You don't scare me, stillwater!" Yet, I can hear the tremble in his voice. "I'm going to fill you with holes and you'll end up begging me for mercy! I bet your legends are no more true than they were for this sad excuse of a mage." Hey! I'll have you know I am, in fact, a strong mage!

The stillwater smirks. "That's funny! That's almost the same thing the people of Olmnar told me. Before I burned their city to the ground."

I blink my eyes rapidly. So this mage, is not only one of those strong enough to destroy a city in an instant, but the very mage that did so.

My hands are not even trembling anymore, they are frozen.

No, it is my entire body that is feeling paralyzed. To be in the presence of such a being, this truly might be the unluckiest day of my life.

The thug and the stillwater stare at each other.

"You're bluffing," the thug says. I hope that might be the truth.

"I guess there's only one way to find out." The stillwater says. His smirk unchanging.

I watch as the two just stare at each other once again. After a long pause, the thug speaks up. "You're in luck, stillwater. I'm feeling merciful today. I'm going to be out of your hair just as soon as I finish this guy here."

Uh-oh. Yeah, this truly is a bad day. I'm sorry Sophia. I don't think I'll be able to come back this time! Please forgive me.

"You do that and you'll regret it." The stillwater replies.

It is as if my eyes have been opened! This man, no, this great mage, is no destroyer! He is a saviour! A saviour, I tell you!

The thug is clearly taken back. "What, are you kidding me? You're going to defend this lowlife?"

"If I have to, do I have to?"

I think I might cry. This might be one of the handful of moments when someone has helped me and it is not out of self-interest.

The thug scowls, clearly not happy with this development. He puts his knives back and spits next to me. I'll say this again,'RUDE!'.

"I'll remember this, stillwater. Don't think I won't. I never forget a face. You'll rue the day you messed with Cutthroat Dave. And the same goes for you, healer in armor. I'll be seeing the both of you again soon."

Ho! I guess I should replace 'Thug' with 'Dave'. Nevermind, he just walked away, into the woods on the opposite side of the clearing we are in.

I sheathe my sword and pick up my shield as I start walking towards this mage. Yes, I, a man who just lost to a common thug named Dave, is going to face to face with a stillwater, the simple presence of whose scared the living hell out of the said thug. But I must do so, because...

"You had no obligation to save me," the words just flow out of my mouth. "But you did so anyway, at the risk of your own life. I cannot let such selflessness go unrewarded. I, Daren, vow from this day that I will you offer you my protection from this moment, and until the end of this tournament. Tell me, brave soul, what is your name?"

Yes, pitifully weaker though I might be in comparison to this man, I shall still do my best to repay this debt.

"It's, uhh... It's Barry. My name is Barry."

"Wait, your name's Barry?"

I end up laughing hard at that. So much for trying to sound dignified. It's not a good thing to think about, but the people of Olmnar died at the hands of... Barry.

I wonder what's the story behind his name. Was he perhaps the most ordinary of the stillwaters? Which led to him being called Barry? As funny as that sounds, it would be truly terrifying if a man that strong was the most average one amonst these behemoths.

"Now that's the wierdest name for a mage I've ever heard in my life. Especially for a stillwater. Do you have something you want to tell me, Barry?" I end up not being able to control my curiosity.

With a smile, Barry answers. "I am not a stillwater, Daren. That thug just assumed I was and I took advantage of the situation."

Hmm? "But you're not one of the locals either. Otherwise that spell of theirs would have alerted us the moment we sensed your presence."

I know it might sound crazy, no, scratch that, it probably does sound crazy, but the organizers of the tournament cast a spell on us all before teleporting us to the continent of Varathia.

And that spell was designed so that we would not be able to harm any of the citizens of this continent. It is supposed to warn us if there is a human nearby that we are not allowed to hurt. If what they have said is correct, then the spell will stop us before we can even hit them, not that I have any reason to doubt them (except for how crazy it sounds) or to fight someone who doesn't attack me first.

Though, it is also supposed to act as a means of communication with the organizers. We had been told that they will transmit the objectives for moving forward in this tournament to each of us individually.

Wait a minute, "So you must be one of the participants then. What reason would you possibly have to participate in a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world?"

Surely, he would not be suicidal enough to be here simply to throw away his life.

The prize that is offered to the winner is... the Magium.

It is said to be the source of all magic. Nobody knows what it looks like or how to obtain it. But it is a fact that it can only be found on this continent, the continent of Varathia. Now it is obvious enough why I would be here. To win this tournament and root out all the evil in this world. So that it is the good that prevails, not just here and there, but everywhere.

Yet, I find it hard to see how the Magium would be useful for him. A common man, that is to say, one not born as a mage has no way of becoming a mage at all. Sure, if he were a woman that would be a different story, but even then, that would simply mean sentencing the woman to a world of pain and suffering, and possibly death.

Truthfully, I did not ever think I'd able to have even an opportunity to use the Magium. After all, it is only found on the continent of Varathia, and even though I have travelled a lot. It is simply impossible to visit this continent. The reason being that you cannot arrive here unless it is by the way of an invitation. Yet, for that you'll have to know someone who already lives here, which is once again impossible unless they have a transceiver. Frankly, it is a ridiculous system. Did I mention that the visitors are kept under strict supervision? Talk about being paranoid.

A transceiver, one of the devices I hold that has helped me stay in touch with my wife no matter how far away I am. Though for some reason, it has stopped working ever since I have arrived here. I suspect it might be an effect of the spell we were put under, yet I have no way to confirm that.

Coming back to the topic at hand, so yes, it is basically impossible to arrive here; or rather, it was impossible to arrive at this continent until now.

An announcement throughout the world by the kings of Varathia, stating that they were organizing a tournament, with every single mage in the world invited. The winner being granted access to the Magium.

It was simply a once in a lifetime opportunity. The solution to all my objectives lie in winning this tournament.

And yet, "Why did you join this tournament, Barry?" I cannot help but wonder.

"It's... It's my sister. She is terminally ill, and the cure for her illness can only be found in this continent. I've tried for months to get an invitation to this place, but they would not hear of it. This was the only way. I can only hope that I'll survive long enough to find what I'm looking for."

Oh! What a noble soul! To go so far for the sake of his sister. I look into his eyes and place a hand on his shoulder.

"We'll find it. Together! I promise I won't let any harm come to you until you achieve your goal!" It is my word.

"Not to sound ungrateful but... I'm not finding this very reassuring." What?!! Why?! "I mean, I did just witness you get completely wrecked by that knife throwing guy. How does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named as Cutthroat Dave, anyways?"

"Oh, that..." I look away in embarassment. Yeah, I can see what he means, but hey! We were supposed to have moved forward from that point, right?

Ughhh! Do I really have to explain it to him? It's really embarassing, I know I did say that it was laughable, but that does NOT mean that I want someone to laugh at it.

With much difficulty, I open my mouth to speak. "You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn't mean that I do not have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the Shield spell properly..."

He inquires in response. "The Shield spell?" Yes. "The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself?" Yes. "But isn't that one of the first spells any mage learns?" Yes, I know.

Okay, but I have a perfect explanation for this. "It is... But it's not like I can't cast it at all... I can defend from magic just fine. It's normal weapons that I have a problem with. This is why I wear armor. This is why I use a sword and a shield. I first started using them because I couldn't use the shield spell properly, but soon, I started tailoring my magic around them, and my very fighting style. I found a master that would teach me to fight with weapons, and I used my magic to enchant them. Then, after every fight, I'd just use my white magic to heal my wounds. Like so..."

I demonstrate it by raising my hands in the air and casting a spell that would heal me. A white light appears around me. Slowly, I feel my wounds closing up and the blood starting to fade away. I have cast this spell so many times, that I can tell its effects without even looking at this point. I wonder if he's surprised by my magic.

Sure enough, when I look at him, I can see the curiosity in his eyes.

I continue explaining. "The cutthroat's knives had a life of their own, and there were many of them attacking me simultaneously. If I had a proper shield spell to defend against them, defeating him would have been child's play. But defending against all those knives with a shield and sword alone would have been impossible regardless of my combat skill. All armors have their weaknesses. All he had to do was go for the armor's joints repeatedly, until he wore me out." I did a pretty good job of explaining how easily I got bested this time. I hope I never have to face him ever again.

"Why are you telling me all of this? Shouldn't you be at least a bit worried about revealing your greatest weakness to someone you just met?" Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

"Hey, you just saved my life! So you can't be that bad, right?" Besides, I already know your weakness. What is it? Really anything that comes at us with the intent to kill. It's not like he has a lot of ways to protect himself. Sure it's gonna be difficult to protect him while fighting off an enemy. But that does not change what I have to do, it simply makes me more determined to carry out my promise.

"Pardon me for interrupting," I hear a woman's voice from behind the trees. "But would you by any chance be Daren, the legendary savior of the Eastern Continent?"
