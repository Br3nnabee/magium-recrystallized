Daren, the legendary healer in armor, an adventurer renowned through the continents, stared at the remote village he called home in the Southern Continent, watching it slowly grow against the horizon as he walked along the dusty road, and felt guilt. This was nothing new to Daren. He understood why he needed to come home to rest every so often, and he certainly loved the companionship of Sophie, his wonderful wife. Everytime he came back home, he would leave mentally stronger than ever thanks to her. He wouldn’t trade the time he spent with her for anything else in the world.

Therein lay the first part of Daren’s guilt, the fact that he would leave Sophie alone again. He hated doing this to her, and understood what a terrible husband he was, but it was a necessary sacrifice if he wanted to save everyone, to end the suffering of the world.

That very desire and drive to do good was the second piece of the guilt. Every second Daren wasn’t out on his adventures, every moment for himself, was a moment he could have saved someone, a time he could have eased their suffering.

These dark thoughts, contradictory in nature, were normal for Daren, and he had long since learned how to suppress them. However, a third guilt hung over his head as he returned home this time. This guilt, while one he felt before, was much rarer, and as such, one he wasn’t as accustomed to dealing with. Daren would only be staying in the village for a couple of days, and despite having the ability thanks to his long range magical transceivers, he still hadn’t brought himself to tell Sophie.

Daren hid his inner turmoil as he reached the village’s gate, putting on a facade of sociability. There was no need to ruin anyone’s day after all, and Sophie always said he should be more outgoing, so he might as well practice a little with people he knew.

Daren saw the village guard, a stocky man with skin as dark as Daren’s and a face more angular than a brick named Gilliam, rush off the raised platform Daren knew was behind the wall to open the gate for him. The wall around the village was pretty ramshackle, and made entirely of wood, but it served its purpose in keeping out the local wildlife from the main portion of the village.

“Daren, it’s been too long,” greeted Gilliam in a jovial tone. The two men gripping each others right forearms before pulling the other in and patting the other on the back in greeting. “Tell me, how does it feel to be greeted by the greatest guard in the village?”

The men let go of each other and Daren gave Gilliam a deadpan look, those who didn’t know Daren might have been put off by his stoic expression, but not the cheerful guard. “You’re the only guard, Gilliam.”

“And by default the best, or so I would say,” Gilliam retorted with a chuckle. “While you were gone these last few months, we decided to double our ranks. Now I finally get some time off.”

“Oh? And what poor soul did you con into doing your job for you?” Daren asked, raising an eyebrow as he leaned slightly closer, exaggerating his slightly piqued curiosity.

Leaning towards Daren in the same manner, as if the matter were gossip and not almost certainly public knowledge, Gilliam replied “George’s kid, Barry. I was actually approached by him. He’s almost sixteen now, and decided to apprentice under me.” The two men went back to standing more naturally. “I said yes and began training the next generation and all that,” Gilliam shrugged.

“Barry. . . Barry. . .” Daren muttered, his brow furrowing in thought. After a moment, recognition dawned on his face as the sides of his lips twitched into the faintest hint of a smile. “Is he the one that fell into the cartful of manure when working on Ron’s farm a few years back?” Daren asked, holding back a laugh that threatened to escape his throat at the memory.

“The very same,” Gilliam confirmed with a chuckle. “He decided to give up on farming after that.”

“Understandable.” Daren remarked, his smile broadening momentarily before naturally dropping.

“Well I won’t keep you, I’m sure Sophie’s excited to see you.” Gilliam said, his tone softening as he gestured towards the direction of Daren’s home.

“Yeah, thanks. Take care Gilliam.” Daren replied, giving him a final nod before turning to head home.

Similarly pleasant, if slightly forced, interactions played out as Daren walked the streets. Whenever he returned home there was always a rush of commotion as he greeted everyone on the way back to Sophie, and this time was no exception.

Daren spoke with Roger, the village’s blacksmith, and he talked about how it’s been too long since he had the occasion to fashion a quality sword instead of horseshoes and scythes. He saw Bertha, the pâtissier, and gladly accepted some biscuits for him and Sophie to enjoy. He passed by Barry, apparently on duty and having to help old man Thomas home, the older gentleman surprisingly drunk for the early hour.

After about a dozen or so more of these interactions, Daren finally found himself facing the front door to the home he shared with Sophie. A simple house with walls of stone and a roof of wood. Daren, hiding his troubled mind, wanting to give Sophie at least one day before he broke the news of how soon he would be leaving to her, knocked on the door.

After a moment the door opened and the most beautiful woman in the world stood before Daren. Her hair, reaching to about the small of her back, was a straight glossy black, and her eyes were only a slightly lighter shade of brown than her skin. Every time he came home he was overtaken with wonder, wonder that this marvelous woman chose to stand by him despite how much he tried to shove her away.

Sophie’s eyes sparkled as she stared at Daren for a brief moment, before throwing her arms around him, pulling him into a tight embrace, her head resting against his chest. “You’re back,” she murmured, the relief in her voice unmistakable. She pulled away slightly, just enough to look up at him. “I missed you.”

Daren smiled down at her. “I missed you too,” he said, his voice softer than its usual brusqueness. “It feels good to be home.”

For a moment, everything felt right. Sophie led him inside, and as he stepped over the threshold, the familiar scent of their home surrounded him. The windows sat open, allowing for a cool breeze to flow in to stifle the heat of summer. Daren’s armor found its way onto the floor, and the bag biscuits from Bertha found their way onto the table, well the ones he and Sophie didn’t immediately grab at least.

The two sat down at the table in the main room, as Daren set to tell her of his recent adventures, even though she had already heard them over the transceiver, sometimes even as they happened. This was something she would insist upon every time he returned home, and he had long since stopped fighting it. He suspected it was her way of trying to fact check his adventures, to make sure they weren’t more dangerous than he let on during their conversations over the transceiver. Daren knew these stories made her worry, but it was better than her trying to force her way along on the adventures as well, so he accepted the arrangement.

Daren was in the middle of telling her about the fire elementals that descended on a village he was protecting last week when he noticed Sophie’s frown. Cutting his story short, Sophie spoke a question that caught him off guard. “What’s wrong?” She asked somewhat

“What do you mean, nothings wrong.” Daren replied, suppressing a wince as he realized that the response was far too quick to be natural.

Immediately pouncing on Daren’s response, Sophie shot out of her seat and began recounting a list of reasons that something was wrong. “One, your daily calls on the transceiver have been ending rather abruptly the last few weeks. Two, you are never excited to tell me the stories of your travels, yet you started without so much as a single comment. Three, your response to my question.” With each point she made Sophie became more and more animated. By the end she had walked around the table and was poking Daren’s chest. She was speaking at nearly twice the volume she started with, putting her just shy of a shout.

Sighing in defeat, Daren’s shoulders dropped. “About three weeks ago now, I found out about a tournament for mages being held on the continent of Varathia” Sophie frowned but patiently awaited the rest of the explanation. “The prize they offer is a magical artifact known as the Magium.”

“I’ve definitely heard that name before. What is this Magium?” Sophie asked after a pause, much calmer than her previous outburst, urging Daren to continue his explanation.

“If rumor is to be believed, it’s the source of all the world’s magic. With it, any mage could grow hundreds, if not thousands of times stronger than they currently are. With it I could. . .” Daren trailed off looking into his wife’s eyes.

“With it you could fulfill your dream.” Sophie spoke in realization. “With it you could save everyone and end their suffering. That’s what you’re thinking right?” She asked tenderly, with something hidden behind her eyes. Worry Daren guessed? No that wouldn’t make sense, it must be anger. She had probably already realized he would be leaving soon.

“Yes.” he replied, getting ready to reveal his departure date, suspecting what she was about to ask.

“I assume you leave soon then, otherwise you wouldn’t have felt so guilty as to try and hide this tournament. When do you leave?” Sophie spoke concealing her emotion.

Fully expecting her to explode with emotion at his response, Daren answered her “I leave the day after tomorrow.”

Surprisingly the outburst didn’t come. “One more question, how extensively was this tournament advertised?”

Caught off guard by how well Sophie was taking this, Daren answered her question with some slight confusion. “Pretty extensively, from what I could tell. It was advertised on at least both the Western and Southern Continents, so I would guess basically every major city received the news, why?”

“So hundreds of the most powerful mages in the world have probably seen this message?” Sophie asked, her voice now completely devoid of emotion.

A pit opened in Daren’s stomach as he realized where this was going. He was right the first time, it was worry he saw in her eyes. He thought she would be upset about the timeframe of his departure, but now he realized that he had to defend the act of departing itself. “Sophie, think of all the liv-”

Cutting off Daren’s reply, Sophie spoke clearly, with her worry no longer being hidden. “You aren’t going, Daren, not alone. This is too dangerous by yourself, even for you.”

“Sophie, you can’t come. As you just said, it's too dangerous. I can’t risk you.”

“LIKE HELL YOU CAN’T!” Sophie shouted at him, her worry quickly giving way to a well meaning anger before receding. She regained some of her composure, eyes desperate in that way they only got when she thought he was being particularly stupid and reckless. “If it’s so dangerous, that’s exactly why you can’t go. You need to protect yourself first and foremost. Daren, you can’t save people if you’re dead.”

Daren shook his head, he wouldn’t budge on this. "I won’t die, Sophie. I’ve faced worse. This is just another challenge I need to overcome."

Sophie crossed her arms, her voice trembling as she spoke again, quieter now, yet somehow more intense. "But it’s not just another challenge, Daren. You said it yourself, this Magium could make anyone a thousand times stronger. Even you have to realize what kind of people you’ll be up against."

Daren’s jaw tightened. He knew she was right. The tournament would attract the most dangerous and most powerful of the world's mages, not just the ones like him who were looking to do good. But that didn’t change his mission. "Sophie, I have to do this. If I don’t go, I won’t be able to live with myself. When I heard about the tournament, I thought that after all these years, I was finally given a sign.” Raw emotion slipped into Daren’s voice as he pleaded with his wife. “I've spent my life fighting to save the world from its pain, but no matter how hard I try, it’s never enough. With the Magium I might finally have a real chance."

Sophie took a deep breath, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I understand that, I do, but you don’t have to do it alone. Please, just take me with you. You know I’ve been practicing in the fighting rings. I can hold my own."

“I can’t Sophie. I won’t be able to protect you there, not in a setting with that many mages.” Daren reached out and gently touched her arm. “You’re strong, one of the strongest women I’ve ever met, and growing stronger every time I see you. But the difference between you and trained mages is too much.”

Sophie deflated, and Daren found himself holding her as she lay against his chest. “I know that.” She mumbled. “I know I can’t go and I know I can’t stop you. Just. . . just promise me you’ll return.”

The two stood there for some time, probably only a few minutes, but to Daren it felt like hours. Eventually, the two ended their prolonged embrace, and Sophie guided Daren to the bedroom.

----------

Daren had left the village about a month ago now. Most of the residents seemed surprised at his abrupt departure, as he usually stayed at least a week or two. Sophie and he had argued a few more times, but they largely went the same as the first. She bid him farewell, and warned Daren that he better return alive, under the threat of death ironically enough. Most of that month was spent traveling to the location of the tournament organizers, as well as procuring some basic supplies, such as new flint and extra rations.

Once there, it had been a surprisingly easy process to enter. The organizers essentially just asked Daren for his name in order to register him as a participant, then cast the spell that supposedly protected locals from the tournament mages on him, and finally teleported him, as well as a wave of other contestants, randomly into the middle of the woods, presumably somewhere on Varathia. Combine the ease of entry with the total lack of objectives or rules given, and Daren found himself wondering how on Earth the tournament could be so disorganized.

Following the teleportation, Daren couldn’t help but feel . . . underwhelmed. Sure, the group teleportation spell was interesting, and Daren couldn’t even begin to comprehend how a spell detecting intent to harm locals would work outside of it being somewhat akin to an enchanter's oath in concept alone. However, the whole process of actually entering the tournament felt . . . off, especially so for a prize as valuable as The Magium.

Daren sensed for anyone in the vicinity, but the only auras he could feel was that of the wildlife. Combining that search with a quick physical one of the immediate area, and Daren was satisfied enough to conclude that there was no one around to hear or see him pull out his transceiver. Daren quickly spun the dial for changing the frequency around in a specific sequence and contacted Sophie, or at least he tried to.

The device wasn’t working, so Daren tried a few more times. Perhaps he had just entered the code wrong. Pulling out a different transceiver, he tried a few more times, maybe the first one was just broken somehow. After about twenty minutes of nothing and three failed receivers, Daren eventually concluded that there was some kind of magic interference around the island that was preventing him from contacting Sophie.

Daren pulled out his enchanting tools from his bag and began fiddling with the device. After maybe a half an hour of this Daren realized that it was no use, as he didn’t know specifically what was jamming the device, so he had no way to actually fix it outside of exhaustive trial and error, something he probably didn’t have time for.

He knew she’d be angry, but Daren concluded that he would just have to wait until after he won the tournament to contact Sophie. Now if only he knew what he actually needed to do to win. From what Daren saw, the contestants were being teleported to the island in waves. Maybe they were just waiting for everyone to arrive on the island before announcing the objectives.

Sensing the area around him once again, Daren noted that there were plenty of mages around by now. He must have been on the earlier side of those teleported. Notably, there was one aura heading straight towards Daren. Daren wasn’t opposed to cooperation with people he found for now, but the aura felt particularly. . . pungent. It was almost like the aura equivalent of not taking a bath for a month.

The man who emerged from the trees and into the small clearing where Daren had spent the better part of his first hour of the tournament definitely matched the disgusting aura. His black beard was as unkempt as the hair on the top of his head. He wore a white shirt with a number of tan stains on it, some kind of booze if Daren had to guess. His pants were simple, worn leather, and similar stains to that of his shirt. What caught Daren’s eye however, were the absurd number of daggers on the man's belt. There had to be at least a dozen.

Daren was immediately put on guard. He had adventured enough to recognize trouble when he saw it, and this man was certainly it. The way he carried himself, the way he looked down on Daren, like a hunter did to his prey. This man was a killer, and he wanted to kill again.

He’s an enchanter, Daren concluded upon seeing his knives. An unfortunate first opponent for Daren, considering his inability to use the shield spell properly. Attempting to diffuse the situation before it began, Daren spoke. “Can I help you, friend? If you would like, I can -” Daren was cut off as a dagger flew towards him, as if it had a mind of its own. He deflected the blade with his left bracer, and quickly drew his sword using his free hand in one smooth motion.

The knives from the man’s belt began to float around him, joining the other lone knife that had found its way back above the man’s head. While the knives gathered, Daren used his left arm to draw his shield from his back. “Actually, yeah. There is something you can help me with. It’s been a while since I got in a good fight. I’m hoping someone as renowned as yourself could give me a challenge.” The man’s voice was as gruff as his appearance would suggest, yet he was actually surprisingly much more articulate than the common bandit. Daren supposed he shouldn’t be surprised, the man was a mage after all. Presumably he had read at least a few books on the subject of magic to feel comfortable entering such a tournament.

Around him, Darren could hear a number of loud booms. The explosions told him that the mages in the area had begun fighting each other as well. “The objectives haven’t even been announced yet. Why waste our energy fighting before the tournament has even begun?” Daren asked, his words as much attempting to diffuse the situation with this man as they were asked in wonder that seemingly every mage had started fighting each other the moment they found someone else.

In response to Daren’s question, the daggers began to fly towards Daren. With a metallic clang every time they connected, Daren’s sword, shield, and armor were enough, if just barely, to fend the daggers off. Unfortunately, Daren was in no position to make his way closer to his assailant, not without serious risk of failing to fend off the daggers.

“Hahahaha!” the man laughed like a story book villain “Is that the best you’ve got? Come on, give me at least a little challenge. Help me build the legend of Cutthroat Dave” The daggers accelerated as the almost certainly self named Cutthroat Dave taunted Daren, gaining speed every time one was deflected. They also began targeting the joints in Daren’s armor, the place where it was weakest. After a few minutes Daren started to take glancing blows, he was slowing as he tired.

Daren realized he was going to die. It wasn’t an abruptly startling realization, he had had this same realization many times over his adventures. Even if he was wrong every time so far it didn’t mean he couldn’t recognize the danger he was in. Realizing he only had one chance, Daren quickly rushed towards the disheveled looking Dave in a truly reckless charge.

Unfortunately, he was clearly anticipating this course of action. The moment Daren rushed him, a wicked smile bloomed on the man’s face, and the daggers suddenly changed direction. Most of them targeted Daren’s wrists, but a number of them wrenched themselves into the backside of Daren’s shield, managing to tear it from his grasp. Quickly turning directions, some of the daggers struck towards his knees, and in attempting to defend them, Daren's right wrist was struck a nasty blow, forcing him to drop his sword.

As Daren fell to his knees, he looked up at the unkempt man as he began to gloat. "The legendary mage Daren! The savior of the Eastern Continent. The healer in armor. They say you've traveled the world, saving countless villages from destruction. That you've once fought ten rock golems by yourself, only to defend a small child. I guess this goes to show, you should never really trust legends, aye? I always knew all of those tales about mages as strong as giants were just codswallop. Hell, if all those 'legendary' mages that joined this tournament are as weak as you, I'm going to win this by sundown!"

Cutthroat Dave. He was going to die to some bastard named Cutthroat Dave? Daren might have laughed if the fate weren’t so tragic. At the very least, he was glad he hadn’t taken Sophie with him. He had absolutely no way to protect her from this thug. Daren awaited the blow that would finish him off, but it never came.

“Wait, who’s there?” Daren heard Dave shout, as he turned towards the tree line. Daren realized that his fight apparently had an observer. He couldn’t sense much magical power from him at all. This poor sap wouldn’t stand a chance against Dave.

WAIT! Suddenly, Daren’s eyes widened in realization, of where he was, of the kind of people who would be here. This was a tournament for the world's most powerful mages, of course stillwaters would have entered. Stillwaters, some of the most powerful of mages. They are nearly indistinguishable from normal humans, but are capable of destroying entire cities with their might. The thug, Dave, continued on, as if oblivious to the danger they were in. “I know you’re there, coward. Show yourself, or I’ll have one of my knives find you!”

“I see no reason to show myself to you.” replies a voice from the tree line. Willing to give up his position, yet not deigning the two with his presence. This was exactly the kind of arrogance Daren would have expected of a stillwater.

After a pause, “A stillwater, eh?” Dave spoke with clear fear in his voice, appearing to fully comprehend his situation. Pushing through that fear might have been brave, if it wasn’t so insanely stupid, but Dave managed to push through that fear anyway. “You don’t scare me, stillwater! I’m going to fill you with holes and you’ll end up begging for mercy! I bet your legends are no more true than they were for this sad excuse of a mage standing next to me.” Daren, despite the fact that he wasn’t exactly standing as much as kneeling, took some offense to the insult. However, Daren decided that the best thing for him would be to keep quiet and let Dave continue to anger the stillwater.

The stillwater’s reply chilled Daren to his very bones. “That’s funny, that’s almost the same thing the people of Olmnar told me. Before I burned their city to the ground.” It was common knowledge that the city of Olmnar, one of the largest on this continent, was destroyed by a stillwater about twenty years ago. If this really was that same stillwater, then neither Daren nor Dave would survive this encounter.

“You’re bluffing.” Dave spoke, fear still present in his voice.

“I guess there’s only one way to find out, then.” presses the stillwater, tension in the air thickening even further.

Just when Daren expected the stillwater would kill them both, Dave began speaking again. “You’re in luck, stillwater. I’m feeling merciful today. I’m going to be out of your hair just as soon as I finish this guy here.”

The stillwater’s response was immediate. “You do that and you’ll regret it.” Upon hearing the stillwater’s words, Daren felt an immense sense of relief. He wasn’t dying yet. And this likely wasn’t actually the one who destroyed Olmnar. No one who would commit a tragedy on such a scale would bother to save a single man.

“What, are you kidding me? You’re going to defend this lowlife?” asked the scraggly bearded lowlife with some surprise.

“If I have to. Do I have to?” To Daren this confirmed it. The stillwater didn’t want to have to kill, even someone like Cutthroat Dave. He was bluffing to save Daren’s life while attempting to dissuade Dave from throwing away his.

“I’ll remember this, stillwater. Don’t think I won’t. You’ll rue the day you messed with Cutthroat Dave. And the same goes for you, healer in armor. I’ll be seeing the both of you again soon.” Dave vowed his revenge, putting on a display of bravado, as he ran away like a coward.

Daren sat up and gathered his wits, as well as his equipment. Using his offhand, Daren sheathed his sword and put his shield along his back once more. Daren then made his way over to the edge of the tree line where stillwater that saved him stood, now emerged and willing to show himself to Daren.

The stillwater’s features were what Daren could only describe as average. He stood there, blending into the background like a figure sketched in pencil, totally unremarkable in every way. There was not a single thing about him that caught the eye. He was like the protagonist of one of those fill in the blank stories that were so popular in the Western Continent. He wasn’t unattractive, nor was he striking, he was just perfectly, overwhelmingly average.

His long-sleeved, buttoned shirt was as forgettable as the rest of him, the kind of outfit you'd see on any given day and immediately forget the moment you turned away. Compared to his show of arrogance earlier he was dressed surprisingly humbly. Daren just took that to mean that the act from before was the stillwater’s way of trying to prevent Dave from doing something stupid enough that he would need to die for.

You had no obligation to save me,” Daren spoke, beginning to express his gratitude. “But you did so anyway, at the risk of your own life.” Obviously the stillwater was never in any actual danger, but Daren intended to thank him properly. “I cannot let such selflessness go unrewarded. I, Daren, vow to this day that I will offer you my protection from this moment, and until the end of the tournament.” He might have needed saving from Dave, but Daren was sure his services could be useful to the stillwater against other opponents. “Tell me brave soul, what is your name?”

The stillwater seemed taken aback by the small speech, before responding to the question. “It’s uhh. . . It’s Barry. My name is Barry.”

Immediately the image of young Barry from his village, covered in cow dung, popped into Daren’s mind. He tried, and failed, to contain his laughter as he asked to confirm if the same was true. Once his laughter had died down somewhat Daren began speaking again. “Now that’s the weirdest name for a mage I’ve ever heard in my life. Especially for a stillwater. Do you have something you want to tell me, Barry?”

"Yes. My parents had a really weird sense of humor,” the stillwater said awkwardly. Perhaps he had hit a nerve? “Speaking of names, aren't you supposed to be a hero of legend? How exactly does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave?"

"Oh, that…” A not insignificant amount of embarrassment showed on Daren’s face from the question. "You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn't mean I don't have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly..."

Barry seemed taken aback at the response. "The shield spell?” he asked in confirmation. “The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself? But isn't that one of the first spells any mage learns?"

"It is... But it's not like I can't cast it at all…” Daren defended. “I can defend from magic just fine. It's normal weapons that I have a problem with. This is why I wear armor. This is why I use a sword and a shield,” much to his master’s disappointment he added in his head.

“I first started using them because I couldn't use the shield spell properly, but soon, I started tailoring my magic around them, and my very fighting style. I found a master that would teach me to fight with weapons, and I used my magic to enchant them. Then, after every fight, I'd just use my white magic to heal my wounds. Like so..." Daren then demonstrated the point by raising his hands in the air to cast a basic healing spell, causing a white light to appear around him. As the light shone, his wounds started closing, and the blood staining his skin faded away.

"The cutthroat's knives had a life of their own, and there were many of them attacking me simultaneously,” Daren continued. “If I had a proper shield spell to defend against them, defeating him would have been child's play. But defending against all those knives with a shield and sword alone would have been impossible regardless of my combat skill. All armors have their weaknesses. All he had to do was go for the armor's joints repeatedly, until he wore me out."

Seemingly baffled, Barry asked Daren "Why are you telling me all of this? Shouldn't you be at least a bit worried about revealing your greatest weakness to someone you just met?"

A reasonable question. Daren, however, had decided to trust the stillwater, and told him as much. "Hey, you just saved my life! So you can't be that bad, right?"

"Pardon me for interrupting," spoke a voice from behind the trees. "But would you by any chance be Daren, the legendary savior of the eastern continent?" Daren’s inviting words died on his tongue as he realized what the speaker was.
