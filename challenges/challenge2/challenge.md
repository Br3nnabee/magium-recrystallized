# Writing Challenge #2:

First of, I'm incredibly sorry it took me this long to publish this. I've been stuck away from home since this morning because I'm moving and I didn't have time to send this before. Having said that, welcome everyone to the second writing challenge! This time we wanted to try something a bit different, so I hope you'll enjoy it :D

### Prompt:

Write an outline for a possible chapter 1 of book 4 using all the information to us available (check #announcements for everything that we've been told regarding book 4&5). Add either

-   3 choices minimum that slightly change the course of the chapter (like talking to different characters, asking different things, etc.),
-   or 1 choice that changes the course of the chapter in a much more meaningful way (going to place B instead of A or ).

It is allowed to do 1 big choice + any number of smaller choices.  

Format: Interactive Fiction Outline 
Minimum word requirement: N/A 
Deadline:  October 7, 2024 9:30 PM 

Entries will need to be submitted [here.](https://forms.gle/nVtTmoPAe3ZEHHL17)

## Part 2

@whatevercomic07  @aviewer.  @ark406  @br3nnabee

 Now that you guys have submitted your outlines, it's time for the secret next half of the challenge that will last until the end of the month.

If you check your DMs you'll find that you've been sent a link to another one of the entries that was submitted. For the rest of the month you'll be tasked with turning as much of that outline as possible into a playable twine game.

If you don't finish in time, it's fine — if you do, it's better — this challenge serves the purpose of familiarizing you all with some of the new processes you'll have to go through once we begin working on the book: 
- outlining an Interactive Fiction game (the first half)
 - writing something that wasn't outline by you + writing into twine (the second half) 

Have fun! :D  

*Depending on how you guys feel like after finishing this, we'll do a third part as well by reshuffling the entries once again and letting other people edit your submissions :D  and yes, this would've been way more fun with more than 4 people but it is what it is*
