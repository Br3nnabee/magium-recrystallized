Book 4 Chapter 1

- The group talks to Azarius some more, and comes to understand his position better.
	- Branch 1: Barry can criticize Azarius and be laughed at by him for being naive.
	- Branch 2: Barry can agree, eliciting shocked responses from the group.
- They continue towards Galamir, talking to Azarius some more.
- Some more light convo.
- Confrontation with Talmak along the road. Talmak, being rather egotistical, decides to go straight for Azarius and prove the superiority of the north. His gang follows suit, with mirrors clashing. This time though, they don't need to rely solely on Melindra's big moment. The fight is far more balanced, and Barry gets to jump straight into combat.
	- Branch 1: Help Azarius and Hadrik. Speed and Toughness checks?
    - Branch 2: Help Kate and Diane. Observation & Premonition checks? 
	- Branch 3: Help Flower/Illuna and Melindra. Reflexes and Magical sense checks?  
	- Branch 4: Try to contact Henry. No checks.
- Although the fight is mostly balanced, the elf surprises the squad with a spell, and they are saved by Henry coming in last-minute. Fighting resumes, but this time, the squad quickly gains the upper hand and overpowers the group. Side chars are killed or surrender, but Talmak and Nolderan are defiant.
	- Branch 1: Try to reason. Halfway through, Talmak tries to attack, and is killed by Azarius.
	- Branch 2: Let them run. They escape and aren't seen again until Galamir.    
	- Branch 3: Kill Talmak. Impacts primarily the negotiations part.
	- Branch 4: Kill Both Talmak and Nolderan. Has a lasting impact on the group's relationship with Daren.
